# One day in Fremont
### Ate breakfast in McDonald`s
* I ate __fired chicken__ and **french fries** for breakfast.
### We sang songs in *chinese KTV*
- That was very funny!
### We ate lunch in **Little Taipei**
- we ate:
1. **Sweet sour Chinese noodles**
2. **fish fillet with pickled vegetable soup**
3. __Boiled beef__
- Awesome food! I like that restaurant! I will come back again!
### Ate dinner in *Korean BBQ*
- Not as good as that Chinese restaurant, but still OK.
### At the end of that day, we ate dessert in a shop from *Hong Kong*.
* Good tasted! I never had that in Fresno.
### Finally, I hope I lived in Fremont!!!
